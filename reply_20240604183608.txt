You can achieve this by using the `resample` method of the DataFrame to resample the data at 1 minute intervals. Then, you can use the `count` method to count the number of entries in each interval. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Resample the data at 1 minute intervals
df_resampled = df.resample('1T')

# Get the first timestamp
first_timestamp = df_resampled.index[0]

# Get 1 minute after the first timestamp
one_minute_later = first_timestamp + pd.Timedelta(minutes=1)

# Get the number of entries in the first minute
num_entries = df_resampled.loc[first_timestamp:one_minute_later].count()

print(f"First timestamp: {first_timestamp}")
print(f"1 minute later: {one_minute_later}")
print(f"Number of entries in the first minute: {num_entries}")
```

This will give you the first timestamp, 1 minute after the first timestamp, and the number of entries in the first minute. Please note that this assumes that your DataFrame is already sorted by the timestamp. If it's not, you might need to sort it first using `df.sort_index()`.
