The error message is saying that the 'DatetimeIndexResampler' object you're trying to access does not have an attribute called 'index'. 

This error commonly occurs when you're trying to resample a pandas DataFrame or Series that is indexed by a DatetimeIndex and then trying to access the 'index' attribute. 

The resample method in pandas is used to resample time-series data, and it returns a new object of the 'DatetimeIndexResampler' type, which is a subclass of the 'GroupBy' class. This new object does not have an 'index' attribute.

Here's an example of what you might be doing:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a time-series DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': pd.date_range(start='1/1/2020', periods=5),
    'value': range(5)
})

df.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# Resample the DataFrame
resampled = df.resample('2D')

# Try to access the 'index' attribute
print(resampled.index)
```

To avoid this error, you can apply an aggregation function (like mean, sum, etc.) after resampling, which will return a DataFrame or Series, and then you can access the 'index' attribute. 

Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Apply an aggregation function after resampling
resampled = df.resample('2D').mean()

# Now you can access the 'index' attribute
print(resampled.index)
```
