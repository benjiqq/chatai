You can use the Python's built-in datetime module to generate timestamps. Here is how you can modify your code to store the reply in a new file with a timestamp:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import datetime

openai = OpenAI("your-api-key")

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci",
  prompt="Translate this English text to French: '{}'",
  max_tokens=60
)

# get the current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# format the timestamp
timestamp = now.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# create a new file with the timestamp in its name
with open(f"reply_{timestamp}.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

In this code, the `strftime` function is used to format the datetime object into a string that can be used in the filename. The format `%Y%m%d%H%M%S` represents a 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day, 2-digit hour, 2-digit minute, and 2-digit second.
