The line of code you provided is using SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, to create a new engine. The engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application. It's "home base" for the actual database and its DBAPI, delivered to the SQLAlchemy application through a connection pool and a Dialect, which describes how to talk to a specific kind of database/DBAPI combination.

The "db_url" is a string that indicates database dialect and connection arguments. SQLAlchemy uses it to connect to a database. The format of the string can be something like:

```python
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')
```

Here:
- "postgresql" is the database system.
- "user:password" are the username and password to connect to the database.
- "localhost" is the server location.
- "mydatabase" is the name of the database.

Please replace these values with the actual details of your database. 

Note: It's not a good practice to hardcode sensitive information like usernames and passwords. Consider using environment variables or some form of secure secrets storage.
